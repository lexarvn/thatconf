FxCop, StyleCop, etc. We'll take a look at some of these tools and explore how they can help identify issues in your code and improve maintainability and decrease errors before you deploy to production. We'll also look at the ability to build your own tool to enforce rules in your specific domain.</p>\r\n\r\n","DescriptionHtmlTruncated":"<p>How do you keep code consistent across a team or make sure your independent code follows accepted standards, use a Static Analyzer tool.
